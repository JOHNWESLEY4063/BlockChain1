The blockchain-based Land Registry System offers a transformative solution to the challenges of traditional land ownership management, including fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies. By leveraging Ethereum's smart contract technology, the system ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof land registration and transfers. It automates critical processes such as ownership verification and property transfer, significantly reducing the risk of forgery and unauthorized transactions. The unique features of blockchain, such as immutability and decentralization, provide a reliable and publicly verifiable record of land ownership, fostering trust among stakeholders and streamlining operations by eliminating intermediaries.
